You gave me only fifty cents.
This car isn't worth repairing.
I wish I earned more money.
He confessed to the murder.

The audience was deeply affected.
After walking for an hour, we stopped to take a rest.
She is always dressed in black.
We've just finished breakfast.
You can say whatever you want to.
Someone is calling you.
I worked hard last month.

She went from London to Paris.
This isn't my key.
It rained for a week.
He pressed the button and waited.
Tom was sobbing.
You don't need to call me.
Since I had met him once before, I recognized him right away.
Please don't forget to put a stamp on the letter before mailing it.
Do you still want to talk to me?
I caught him by the arm before he could fall.
You're very resourceful.
Do you love music?
Her idea is better than yours.
Do you know how to use this?
